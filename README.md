# Volume Rendering

## Overview

This Node.js application is designed to render a 3D object based on a set of cut-away view images using the Three.js library. By providing multiple cross-sectional images, the application reconstructs and visualizes the 3D object in a browser.

## Features

- **3D Object Rendering**: The application processes a set of cut-away view images and uses Three.js to render the corresponding 3D object
- **Three.js Integration**: Utilizes the powerful Three.js library for rendering 3D graphics and displaying them in a web-based environment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## Important Notes

- Ensure that the input images are properly aligned and represent consistent cross-sections of the object to get an accurate 3D rendering
- This application is designed for educational and basic 3D object visualization and may require further customization for more complex objects
